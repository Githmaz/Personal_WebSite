            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Githma Senevirathne, an enthusiastic and adaptable undergraduate Software Engineer from Sri Lanka. I discovered my passion for technology early, starting programming during my school days. I thrive on challenges and am deeply interested in AI, gaming, and cutting-edge technologies like Unreal Engine 5.</p>
            <p>At university, I'm honing my skills in Java, which is my main programming language, alongside modern web technologies and frameworks such as Spring Boot and Angular. I'm also a proud member of the Richmond College ICT society and indulge in my love for photography, swimming, and traveling.</p>
            <p>Driven by my childhood dream, I am dedicated to evolving into a professional role where I can contribute to impactful projects and innovate with technology.</p>
